# PALO-TEST - Time Travel Macine

#### Problem Statement :
You have been awarded with a task to build a clock which goes back in time (in other words
tick backwards)
Requirements -
1. You’re application should accept 1 parameter from the user which is
DECREMENT_BY_SECS
2. As current time increments by 1 second you’re required to decrement time by the
number of seconds provided as a parameter.
3. Add necessary validations and handle exceptions.

#### Additional notes for the assignment:
1. Make necessary assumptions as needed. You’re free to use any programming
language of your choice for this task.
2. Unit tests over excessive documentation - to ensure you have understood the
problem statement and have solutioned even for the edge cases.
3. Containerise your application (docker / kubernetes) so it’s easier for the interviewer
to run your application without worrying about the dependencies.
4. Add README.MD to provide steps to run your application.
